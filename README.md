# Leaf C Utilities
A collection of datatypes, macros, and functions that I consistently have to remake in different projects. Mainly for ease-of-life and high-level datatypes

# Files
Each subfolder under `src` can be included seperately when/where needed

Module Documentation is found under `src/[module-name]/README.md`. For example, the hashmap module documentation is found at `src/hashmap/README.md`, for further questions or discusion feel free to shoot me a message/email or ask under the discussion tag.

The debug subfolder, `src/[module-name]/debug/**`, is for testing purposes, and therefore is unneeded in distribution settings.
